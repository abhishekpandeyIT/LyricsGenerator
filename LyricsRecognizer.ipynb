We are also working together in Renewable Energy.\nAlmost 250 students from South America, have been taking courses in India every year under our International Technical and Economic Cooperation program. I however believe, that this is not enough. We intend to substantially increase the same.\nTo share India's expertise in Information Technology, we will establish Centres of Excellence in Information Technology, in South American countries.\nIndia also offers to expand cooperation, in areas like Tele-medicine, Tele-education and e-Governance. We extend our Space capabilities, for weather forecasting, resource mapping and disaster management. Our ongoing Parliament session in Delhi – my Government's first – prevents me from spending more time here, on this visit. But, I look forward to returning to this great continent; of beauty, opportunities and warm people. I also look forward, to a much more intensive level of engagement, between India and South America, in the coming years, across all domains of cooperation \nThank you.\n#DELIMITER#\n16 7 2014, Brazil\nBRICS Summit\nYour Excellency, President Dilma Rousseff \nYour Excellency, President Vladimir Putin \nYour Excellency, President Xi Jinping \nYour Excellency, President Jacob Zuma \nDistinguished delegates, ladies, and gentlemen \nI am delighted to be in Brazil. I thank President Rousseff, the Government, and the wonderful people of Brazil for their hospitality. \nThis is my first BRICS summit and it has been a truly enriching experience. I have gained a lot from the insight and vision of the World Leaders gathered here. \nI have also had the privilege of sowing the seeds of personal relationships with each of the leaders. I look forward to seeing them blossom into deep and strong personal bonds in the days to come. \nExcellencies, BRICS enters the second cycle of its summits today. \nThis Summit takes place at a crucial juncture. The World is facing a high level of economic and political turmoil. Conflict and instability is growing in many key regions. \nThis increases the challenges of tackling poverty, making growth more inclusive, and evolving a sustainable model of development. \nRestoring a climate of peace and stability is an urgent global need. This calls for newer avenues of cooperation and collaboration. \nI believe BRICS can answer this call. This I do because of the uniqueness of BRICS as an international institution. For the first time it brings together a group of nations on the parameter of ‘future potential’; rather than existing prosperity or shared identities. The very Idea of BRICS is thus forward-looking. \nI therefore believe it can add fresh perspectives and mechanisms, to existing international institutions. \nThus, we must ensure that the future development of our partnerships, and institutions, stays true to this original idea. \nBRICS must provide a united and clear voice in shaping a peaceful, balanced and stable World. \nWe should intensify our cooperation in confronting global challenges; like Terrorism, Cyber Security and Climate Change. \nBRICS must also play a proactive role in shaping the global discourse on Growth and Development. This includes shaping the post-2015 Development Agenda to keep the central focus on tackling Poverty. \nWe must seek urgent reforms of global institutions of governance like the UN Security Council and international financial institutions. \nWe must help shape the WTO regime. An open trading regime is critical for strong, balanced and sustainable global economic growth. \nThis must address the development aspirations of the developing world. \nIt must also accommodate the special needs of the weak especially in areas such as Food Security. \nExcellencies, BRICS has gained enough horizontal influence to compel the world to take notice. Our own greater good, however, lies more in deepening our bonds vertically. \nThis is why I have spoken on decentralizing this powerful forum in our earlier deliberations. We must proactively move beyond being Summit-centric. \nWe must champion Sub-national Level exchanges. Champion engagement between our States, Cities and other local bodies. \nBRICS should in fact, be driven by ‘People to People’ contact. Our Youth in particular must take a lead in this. BRICS should explore developing innovative mechanisms of Youth engagement. A possible initiative, could focus on nurturing Innovation, by establishing a BRICS Young Scientists’ Forum. \nAnother possibility, could be the setting up of BRICS language schools; offering language training in each of our languages. \nWe could, also consider establishing, Massive Open Online Courses, for making quality education, accessible to all. \nWe could also explore setting up a BRICS University. This would connect campuses in each of our countries; virtually, as well as through intensive student, faculty and research collaboration. \nExcellencies, I am convinced that each of us can succeed more by working together more closely. \nWe must harness each other’s strengths, in knowledge, skills and resources. \nWe must evolve mechanisms to share our experiences, innovations and technology. Numerous avenues can be explored, such as: \n• Sharing our experiences on development of affordable and reliable Clean Energy technologies.\n• Harnessing advanced technology, like satellite communication, to make quality Health and Education more accessible. \n• Developing a Framework for promoting Tourism among BRICS countries. \n• Sharing experiences on Disaster Management, and \n• Collaboration and Competitions in Sports \nExcellencies, Economic forces are becoming increasingly important in global relationships. Domains like; Trade, Tourism, Technology, Tradition and Talent; have the power, to redefine existing paradigms. \nEach of us in BRICS brings a unique blend of experience and resources. We represent four continents. Each one of us enjoys comparative advantages and complementary strengths. BRICS should develop mechanisms to harness the same; for furthering our combined as well as individual good. Great work has already been done in this domain. \nThe vision of a New Development Bank, at the Delhi Summit two years ago, has been translated into a reality, in Fortaleza. It will benefit BRICS nations. But will also support other developing nations. And, it will be rooted in our own experiences, as developing countries. \nThe BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement gives BRICS nations a new instrument for safeguarding their economic stability. This is an important initiative at a time of high volatility in global financial markets. \nThe MoU on Cooperation between Export Credit Guarantee Agencies, and the inter-Bank Cooperation Agreement on Innovation are other tangible steps that will spur cooperation among BRICS countries. \nI believe we have now reached a level where we should be even more ambitious.We should focus on more such tangible mechanisms and outcomes. Make BRICS a platform of Impact. \nExcellencies, we have an opportunity, to define the future – of not just our countries, but the world at large. Coming from a land where the idea of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam - the ‘whole world being one family’ - is rooted deep in our ethos; I take this is as a great responsibility. \nOur steps must reinforce the hopes, aspirations and confidence, of the developing world. \nOnce again, I thank President Rousseff and the wonderful people of Brazil, for hosting this Summit.\n#DELIMITER#\n16 7 2014, Brazil\nBRICS Business Council\nExcellencies, \nDistinguished members of the Business Council \nLadies and Gentlemen,\nI believe, economic forces are becoming increasingly important in global relationships. \nDomains like Trade, Technology, Tourism, Talent and Tradition have the power to redefine existing paradigms. \nI am thus pleased, that we established, the BRICS Business Council, in Durban, last year.\nIt is important, that our business leaders lead the effort in promoting trade, investment and manufacturing ties, among our countries.\nI appreciate the work done by the Council.\nVarious enabling agreements, and MoUs; have already been signed between BRICS Development Banks, to promote intra-BRICS trade and investment. \nI would suggest the Business Council work in close coordination with the Development Banks, and, the Contact Group on Trade and Investment Issues. \nThe suggestions presented in the Annual Report are important. The Council should work closely with BRICS Sherpas to see how these suggestions can be taken forward.\nI am also happy to note that the Council has gone beyond BRICS to make concrete proposals for contributing to the growth, and development of the larger African region.\nIndia remains committed to partnering with African countries in their developmental initiatives.\nI once again, express my appreciation for the good work that has been done.\n#DELIMITER#\n15 7 2014, Brazil\nBRICS Summit, Sustainable development and growth\nThe global economic environment remains uncertain and challenging. Recovery is still fragile despite improved prospects. \nIn an environment of political conflict and persisting weakness in major economies; we have to be watchful for signs of a new bout of financial turmoil. \nDevelopments in Iraq and the wider region could affect this. I am also concerned that tight monetary policies in some countries couldundercut investment and growth in ours.\nAn open, rule-based, international trading regime is critical for global economic growth.\nIt must address the aspirations of the developing world. \nIt must also accommodate the special needs of the most vulnerable sections of our societies, especially in areas such as food security. \nThis is our broad expectation from the negotiations in the Doha Round of WTO. \nExcellencies, \nThe Agreement towards setting up the BRICS New Development Bank is a significant step. I am happy, the initiative announced at the BRICS Summit in New Delhi in 2012, has become a reality. \nThe agreement on the BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement is another major achievement. \nI compliment our Finance Ministers for concluding these two initiatives so quickly. \nThese initiatives are rooted in our own experience as developing countries. \nThey show our capacity to set up global institutions. \nThey will open new avenues for supporting development in our countries as well as helping other developing nations. \nWe should ensure these institutions establish a new model for supporting growth and stability. \nExcellencies, the theme of this Summit is also the guiding principle of my Government. For us, inclusion is a special challenge and responsibility; given our vast social, regional and economic diversity.\nOur policies will focus on empowering people with skills and opportunities.\nWe will invest heavily in infrastructure, affordable housing, healthcare,education and clean energy.\nWe will harness all possibilities that advanced technologies open up.\nAll this will require fast-tracking of Growth. \nWe will champion, clean and frugal resource use; to maintain the Sustainabilityof our development process, without constraining our growth. \nSustainability has in fact been a core element of the Indian way of life. As Mahatma Gandhi had said, the World has enough, for everyone’s Need, but not for everyone’s Greed. We can all partake of the bounty of nature. However, exploitation of nature is a crime.\nWe have made progress, on the Millennium Development Goals. But widespread poverty still haunts us. \nWe must keep poverty eradication at the centre of the post-2015 Development Agenda. \nIt is important to shape the global discourse on the same, especially in forums like the UN. BRICS can be a major voice on the world stage to build consensus towards such efforts.\nExcellencies, \nBRICS is in a position today where it wields enough horizontal influence to compel the world to take notice.\nOur own good, however, lies in deepening our bonds vertically. \nWe must focus on further decentralizing, this powerful forum. \nWe must go beyond Summit and Leader-centric deliberations; and champion Sub-national Level exchanges. We must encourage engagement between our States, Cities and other local bodies. \nBRICS should in fact be truly driven by ‘People to People’ contact. Our Youth, in particular, must take a lead in this. \nPopularizing our languages through dedicated BRICS language schoolsin all BRICS countries could be a beginning in this direction. \nWe could also consider establishing Massive Open Online Courses for making quality education accessible to all.\nWe could even explore the idea of a BRICS University. \nToday, technology is a transformative toolin every area of social and economic development. \nThe vast pool of talent in BRICS could be combined to cooperate in areas like: health, education, agriculture, resource management and urban development. \nPerhaps a Young Scientists’ Forum of BRICS Countries could be explored.\nOther initiatives could include: \nAn affordable healthcare platform of BRICS nations. \nMechanism to further cooperation, between our Small and Medium enterprises.\nAnd, a common framework for promoting Tourism among BRICS countries.\nI am aware of the comprehensive proposals that our Chinese and Russian partners have put forward to deepen BRICS cooperation. \nOur Sherpas should examine them urgently.\nLet us deepen our bonds to make BRICS a stronger instrument of progress, for all mankind.\nThank you\n#DELIMITER#\n14 6 2014, India\nDedication of INS Vikrmaditya to country\nMy greetings to all my beloved fellow countrymen who have dedicated their lives protecting our great country India! I have come out of Delhi for the first time as a Prime Minister and have come directly to you. I believe this will help you understand the priorities of the new government. \nTo ensure that our country supersedes the new heights set for development, to ensure that the poorest of the poor live with happiness and peace and the single most important pre-condition is that India should be safe. And for this safety the biggest driving force are the armed forces be it the Army, the Navy or the Air Force. It is the ability, sacrifice and dedication of our soldiers that ensures a peaceful sleep to the 125 crore Indians. In today’s scenario, the armed forces have undergone sea change. Modern technology has become an important component in the field of security. Hence for a nation to be equipped with the most advanced defence technologies and armaments is as important as the pooling up of dedicated, talented and courageous souls in its armed forces. Today is an important day in the history of India’s security and through our Navy that this golden chapter is being added to it. \nVikramaditya is being dedicated to the soldiers of the Navy. A new and important step is getting imprinted in India’s security. The common man of the country would not be able to comprehend the importance of Vikramaditya as this is not his domain but to those soldiers of the Navy, who have decided to dedicate their lives for the Mother India, very well know and understand the potential of Vikramaditya. It is a matter of great pride and happiness for me that I have the opportunity of being amongst you in this historical moment when Vikramaditya is being inducted to the fleet, to be able to understand its potential and strength and also to take pride in India’s valour. \nThe Navy has won accolades in many fields. In the entire history of mankind, Shivaji was the first person to float the concept of a naval force and its basic association was less with war. Its main aim was to protect the ships going for International trade and it was Shivaji’s dream that India should become a powerful country in world trade. Hence he thought of protecting the individuals involved in trade and with this the concept of a naval force came into existence centuries ago. Today, naval forces have become very important for all those countries having long coastlines or who are close to the sea. The competition in modern science and technology has also become equally important. The Navy has adopted the methodology of ‘Indigenous Technology’, the scientists from our very own India in conjunction with the inputs from Navy slowly developed ‘Indigenous Technology’ and has entered in the field of strategic warfare and in the very near future we plan to take it forward. \nWe have to come out of the situation very soon when a country like India still imports defence equipments even after so many years of Independence. India has to move forward in the field of self-sufficiency in defence offset production and India should become a hub of such equipment for smaller nations of the world. The smaller nations should have faith that they have reliable defence equipment made in India by the Indian youth. We should move forward with the dream that smaller nations should be inculcated the faith that they will never accept defeat. \nThe talent, innovation, research, technological upgradation capabilities of the Indian youth coupled with our strong deterrence will make us an unbeatable power and no one will dare to undermine us. The safety of the nation is associated not only with the soldiers of all the three forces but also with the temperament of the people in power. India neither wants to undermine any country’s sovereignty nor are we going to live with heads bowed down. We may be a very strong nation, but we do not intend to threaten anyone, rather we wish to move together. At the same time we are not ready to bow down and the Indian government has the capability to see anyone in the eye and make its point. And at the root cause of this courage is the preparation and courage of our soldiers and that gives us this strength. \nToday, I had the chance to see this huge development meant for our defence forces. For hours, I have been looking at this ship from every angle - from top to bottom and from right to left. I have been told that more than 1600 soldiers have been deployed on it simultaneously. Our air fleet will be able to take off and land from this ship. This is an important development from strategic point of view and today we have received an important gift. I offer my heartiest wishes to all the naval officers of the country. \nThe preparation required on the coast is much more than the readiness required in the sea. Training of the citizens there is equally important for the help of the navy. A network of Naval NCC needs to be created in the coastal areas. Through the medium of Naval NCC, patriotic youth force can emerge as a powerful tool which can provide the navy with critical information and help from behind the scenes and we want to work in this direction in the near future. I would again like to give my good wishes to the soldiers of the Army, Navy and Air force on this pious occasion today. \nThis new government has made some important decisions. For many years the soldiers have had a wish. I do not know why that task was not undertaken by the previous governments. May be it is my destined good fortune to do this good and holy task. And so this government has decided to create a National level War Memorial. The future generations may be reminded of those who in the post independence era laid down their lives for the country, which is why we have decided to take this step. \nOne rank one pension has been a long battle, it has witnessed many ups and downs, many promises were made but the intention was never evident. This government just does not make promises, it has the intention to implement it too. We are committed to implement one rank one pension scheme. \nI again dedicate the Vikramaditya to the navy, which has sun like brightness in its name that inspires to win many a wars ahead. I wish that your life may be filled with the same brightness, valor and the conviction to be always victorious. \nJoin me in saying, Bharat Mata Ki Jai!Bharat Mata Ki Jai!Bharat Mata Ki Jai!\n"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"60QCTgD7C5cn","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":54},"outputId":"53fc4d53-67be-46b5-80e4-035371b70d0b","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1589206019980,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":1289,"user":{"displayName":"Abhishek Pandey","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gjg4-sUqw6H-gluRTBgRQ5JFkTg6JzP-cfx1m-eTQY=s64","userId":"16444151548817965304"}}},"source":["data[1000:5000]"],"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"'ralism, unity and integrity, in a country of glorious diversity. These are not small achievements. Yet, we now live in an age where change is constant and we are variables.\\nWe must change for both external and internal reasons. Each country has its own experiences, its own resources and its own strengths. Thirty years ago, a country might have been able to look inward and find its own solutions. Today, countries are inter dependent and inter connected. No country can afford any longer to develop in isolation. Every country has to benchmark its activities to global standards, or else fall behind.\\nChange is also necessary for internal reasons. The younger generation in our own country is thinking and aspiring so differently, that government can no longer afford to remain rooted in the past. Even in families, the relationship between the young and old has changed. There was a time when elders in a family knew more than those who were younger. Today, with the spread of new technology, the situation is often reversed. This increases the challenge for government in communicating and in meeting rising expectations.\\nIf India is to meet the challenge of change, mere incremental progress is not enough. A metamorphosis is needed.\\nThat is why my vision for India is rapid transformation, not gradual evolution.\\n• The transformation of India cannot happen without a transformation of governance.\\n• A transformation of governance cannot happen without a transformation in mindset.\\n• A transformation in mindset cannot happen without transformative ideas.\\nWe have to change laws, eliminate unnecessary procedures, speed up processes and adopt technology. We cannot march through the twenty first century with the administrative systems of the nineteenth century.\\nFundamental changes in administrative mindsets usually occur through sudden shocks or crisis. India is fortunate to be a stable democratic polity. In the absence of such shocks, we have to make special efforts to force ourselves to make transformative changes. As individuals, we may absorb new ideas by reading books or articles. Books open the windows of our minds. However, unless we brainstorm collectively, ideas remain confined to individual minds. We often hear of new ideas and understand them. But we do not act upon them, because it is beyond our individual capacity. If we sit together, we will have the collective force to convert ideas into action. What we need is a collective opening of our minds, to let in new, global perspectives. To do this, we have to absorb new ideas collectively rather than individually. It requires a concerted effort.\\nAs many of you know, ever since taking office, I have personally participated in structured brainstorming sessions with bankers, with police officers and with Secretaries to Government, among others. The ideas coming from those sessions are being incorporated into policy.\\nThese efforts have been to tap ideas from inside. The next step is to bring in ideas from outside. Culturally, Indians have always been receptive to ideas from elsewhere. It is said in the Rigveda – “आ नो भद्राः क्रतवो यन्तु विश्वतः”, which means, let us welcome noble thoughts flowing in from all directions.\\nThis is the purpose of the Transforming India Lecture Series. It is a series which we will attend, not as individuals but as part of a team who can collectively make change happen.\\nWe will draw the best from the wisdom and knowledge of eminent persons, who changed, or influenced change in the lives of many, to make their nation a better place in the planet.\\nThis lecture will be the first in a series. You have all been given a feedback form. I look forward to your detailed and frank feedback to help us improve this process. I request you to suggest names of experts and panelists from inside and outside India. I also request all Secretaries to Government to conduct a follow up discussion in a week’s time, with the participants from their Ministries.
